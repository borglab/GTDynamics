# MuJoCo Models (Bootstrap, Not Checked In)

This folder is intentionally kept lightweight. Large MuJoCo model assets are **not** committed to this repository.

## Bootstrap

Run:

```bash
python scripts/bootstrap_mujoco_models.py
```

The script will sparse-clone MuJoCo Menagerie at a pinned commit and create local symlinks under this folder.

## Source models

Pinned source repository:
- https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie

Pinned commit:
- `a03e87bf13502b0b48ebbf2808928fd96ebf9cf3`

Models fetched:
- `unitree_g1`
- `unitree_a1`
- `boston_dynamics_spot`

## Notes

- No mesh/XML transforms are applied. Models are used as-is from menagerie.
- `webdemo/public/examples/scenes/<model>` symlinks are also created by the bootstrap script.
- `webdemo/public/examples/scenes/files.json` is regenerated by the script based on fetched assets.
